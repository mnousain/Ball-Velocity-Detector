# Ball Velocity Detector
This program allows a user to detect the release velocity, angle, and height of a ball and calculate its estimated distance from a short video clip

## How To Run

To run the program, open terminal or command prompt, and write the following command:

```python ballDetection.py -v freeShot.mp4```

Once the video opens, draw a box around the basketball and press enter. This tracks the ball
and calculates the initial distance, velocity, and estimated distance in pixels.
